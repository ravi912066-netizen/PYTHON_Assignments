            # You do not need to take any input.
            # Output
            # Print the date and time in the mentioned format using the already defined variables.
            # Example
            # Output:Date:2025-05-25,Time:14:30:00

    # Problem in your code:
        #In Python 3, numbers with a leading zero like 05 or 00 are not allowed (they give a SyntaxError).
        #âœ… Instead, just write them normally as 5 and 0.
